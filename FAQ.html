        <h1 class="FAQh">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) </h1>
            <h2 class="FAQh2">Shipping: </h2> 
                    
 <h3 class="FAQh3"> I just placed my order. When will it ship?</h3> 
            <p class="FAQp">
Orders usually ship within 3-5 business days after being placed. In colder months, orders may be held for the safety of the plant. LetGrow will immediately notify you if this is the case. 
 </p>
             
<h3 class="FAQh3">Do you ship on holidays?</h3>
             <p class="FAQp">
If orders are placed on a nationally observed holiday, they will be processed on the next available business day.
             </p>
            
<h3 class="FAQh3">My shipping address is wrong. What do I do?</h3>
             <p class="FAQp">
If your shipping address is wrong, let us know by       email (help@letgrow.com) within 24 hours. 
        </p>      
         
<h3 class="FAQh3">Do you ship outside of the United States?</h3>
             <p class="FAQp">
Currently we do not have the resources to ship outside of the United States and its surrounding territories. However, we’re still a growing company and this is our next big step!
 </p>
                     
<h3 class="FAQh3">My package still hasn’t shown up!?</h3>
            <p class="FAQp">
Sometimes our shipping partners get a little too excited with their package statuses! If your shipping shows ‘delivered’ and is nowhere to be found, please wait a day or two and keep checking! If you’re still having problems, shoot us an email at help@letgrow.com.                     </p>
            
            <h2 class="FAQh2">Plants: </h2>
              <p class="FAQp">
            <h3 class="FAQh3">Why are my plants sad looking?</h3>
            <p class="FAQp">
Although we do package our plants with the most love and care, they still are completely living organisms! Most don’t like dark places. They may need a few days to recover from shipping and could potentially lose a few leaves. Make sure to give them ample light and water for the next few days. If they’re not back to normal within a week, send us an email and let us know what’s up!

            <h3 class="FAQh3">My plant is losing leaves like crazy. What can I do?</h3>
            <p class="FAQp">
Without seeing your plant in person, we couldn’t tell you exactly what’s wrong with it. However, we can give you some ideas. The one thing we can say, is that your plant is stressed because it is behaving this way. A few things:
Are the leaves yellowing? See if your plant has new growth. A good rule that can be used for many plants is that for every new leaf gained, an old leaf drops. This is completely normal. Another common cause of yellowing leaves is inefficient watering. Stick your finger about two inches down in your soil and check it. If it is extremely wet, you may be overwatering. Extremely dry? It may be time for some water! 
Is the plant near a window or somewhere where temperature may fluctuate highly throughout the day? This can stress a plant out! Try and move it to a more neutral place for a while and check on it every so often. 
Are the leaves drooping? It’s probably just time for the plant to have a drink!

            <h3 class="FAQh3">My plant looks different from the pictures posted of it.</h3>
             <p class="FAQp">
	All plants are different – and this isn’t a bad thing! There can always be variations in growth, color, and age. We try our hardest to have the most quality and consistent plants, but there will always be variations. If this becomes a problem, please email us at help@letgrow.com.

            <h3 class="FAQh3">My plant arrived damaged.</h3>
             <p class="FAQp">
We try our hardest to package and secure our products for transit, but stuff happens!
Shipping can be brutal on a plant. Please take a photo of the defective product and
send it to us at help@letgrow.com within 2 days of receiving it. Send us some
details if necessary and please include your order number. We will do our best to get
it to you swiftly and safely!

            <h3 class="FAQh3">Can I return a plant I don’t like?</h3>
             <p class="FAQp">
Unfortunately, we cannot accept any returns on plants once they are shipped out. This would cause extra stress on an already needy plant. If your plant arrived damaged, please send us a photo and we will be happy to replace it!
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="FAQh2">Orders: </h2>
              <p class="FAQp">
            <h3 class="FAQh3">Do you accept returns?</h3>
             <p class="FAQp">
Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on plants. We are happy to replace a damaged plant or planter, however. Email pictures of everything to help@letgrow.com and we’ll take care of you. 

            <h3 class="FAQh3">Can I change the contents of my order?</h3> 
            <p class="FAQp">
We try to ship orders the very next day if the product is readily available. Please try and let us know within 24 hours if your order needs to be modified. 

            <h3 class="FAQh3">How do I cancel an order?</h3>
             <p class="FAQp">
The process for cancelling an order must be completed within 24 hours of it being placed. Please send us an email describing what’s up and we’ve got you!
